# 01 — Executive Summary

## 1.1. Overview
**Inventory AI** is a specialized SaaS platform designed for the hospitality industry to modernize wine and beverage inventory management. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and seamless POS integration, it transforms a historically manual, error-prone task into a streamlined digital process.

## 1.2. Business Purpose
The primary objective of Inventory AI is to provide businesses with absolute control over their liquid assets. In high-volume wine bars and restaurants, inventory leakage, incorrect counting of partial bottles, and pricing discrepancies can lead to significant financial loss. This platform provides the tools to:
- **Minimize Loss**: Track every milliliter through precise partial bottle counting.
- **Save Time**: Reduce labor costs by automating identification and data entry.
- **Ensure Accuracy**: Synchronize directly with the source of truth (Syrve POS).

## 1.3. Value Proposition

### 1.3.1. Intelligent Identification
Using advanced Vision AI, the platform can identify wine labels from a single camera shot. This eliminates the need for staff to be wine experts or manually search through thousands of SKUs.

### 1.3.2. POS-First Integration
Unlike standalone inventory apps, Inventory AI is built to be a companion to **Syrve (iiko)**. It doesn't just track stock; it synchronizes catalog data, price lists, and pushes final inventory documents directly into the POS system for financial accounting.

### 1.3.3. Bias-Free Counting
The "Staff" role is intentionally restricted from seeing expected stock levels. This forces a true physical count, preventing "pencil whipping" where staff simply enter the numbers they expect to see.

### 1.3.4. Multi-Tenant Scalability
Designed from the ground up for multi-tenancy, the platform supports restaurant groups with multiple locations, centralized management, and aggregated reporting.

## 1.4. Key Business Metrics Impacted
- **Inventory Variance**: Reduction in discrepancy between POS records and physical stock.
- **COGS Accuracy**: Better financial reporting through precise stock value tracking.
- **Labor Hours**: Significant reduction in time spent on weekly or monthly counts.
- **Par Level Health**: Fewer "out-of-stock" scenarios through automated par level alerts.
